## Troubleshooting

Problem: "Command not found" after installation
Solution: Ensure /usr/local/bin is in your PATH:
bash

echo $PATH | grep /usr/local/bin

Problem: Missing package managers not detected
Solution: APM silently ignores unavailable package managers

Problem: Permission denied errors
Solution: Run with sudo when needed or check file permissions
